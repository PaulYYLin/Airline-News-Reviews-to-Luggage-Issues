0,Aeromexico,5,"""Return flight had problems""",30th March 2025,True,"   I booked London - Mexico City - London Business Class tickets. Outgoing flight gave us access to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow and it was excellent. Return flight had problems: could not check in or select meal on-line using iPad (their website only works on Microsoft). Though in transit, I had to go through immigration, baggage reclaim and security before handing back my luggage to be loaded on the flight home. Refused admittance to their Heineken lounge because I presented more than 3 hours early (just arrived on their flight from Cuba) Lounge was noisy, cramped and spartan when I did get in. But flight was good.",,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to London,March 2025,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3,no

My flight to my winter destination, the charge by WestJet was $75 for my golf clubs. During my flight I had requested an alcoholic beverage and was told they didn’t have any. Upon arrival in Toronto my golf club travel bag was basically destroyed. Very disappointed.",,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico city to Toronto,March 2025,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,2,no
2,Air Canada rouge,10,"""showing if the bathroom is occupied""",29th March 2025,False,"  Flight was awesome. Staff was awesome. My issue is the fact that Air Canada doesn't notify people that there is a light showing if the bathroom is occupied or not. Green if available, red if occupied. The stewardess had to keep returning people to their seats as they kept lining up and blocking the aisle. A simple glance can tell you if there is someone already in the bathroom. In the business section they keep the curtain closed. You might think no one is using the bathroom but it could be the pilot or co-pilot, but a simple glance up will show you that it is available or not.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250327_194908-1-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Dominican Republic,March 2025,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes
3,Air India,1,"""can’t carry more than 15 kg""",3rd April 2025,True,"   I spoke to Air India call center before booking my flight as I had Thai airlines booked at 23:30 from Delhi to Sydney. I asked the lady am I allowed 25 kg plus 7 as I have connected international flight with Thai, she put on hold and replied yes you will be allowed 25 kg plus 7. When I reached Chandigarh airport the staff said no u can’t carry more than 15 kg, you can only carry 25 if you have connected international flight through Air India. I had to suffer and I miss my flight, she said you can board the flight without the luggage, which was a joke, I had to reissue my Thai ticket where I had to pay a penalty of $420 plus the fare I spend on this flight.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chandigarh to New Delhi,April 2025,,,,1.0,,,1,no
4,Air Transat,2,"""insists that my carry-on is too big""",31st March 2025,True,"   I had the most ridiculous experience on my way back from Portugal. We had only brought carry-ons and checked-in online, but to get our boarding passes they made us get in line and go through check-in anyway. When we get to the front a worker insists that my carry-on is too big, even though we took the same plane on the way there and there was no issue!! I tell her ""this makes no sense. We flew with you guys here and it fits in the over head"" so she tells me to weigh it and says it's overweight. It turns out the rules online say the weight requirements are ""light enough that you can lift it without assistance"". So they make me pay 76 EUROs to check it and then I find out the flight was full. I guess they were trying to make room, but instead of asking people to check their carry-on for free like normal, they wanted to ring more cash out of people who booked a flight with just carry on bags. I take 6 trips a year with the same carry on bag and have never experienced this.

6,Akasa Air,4,"""way they handle passengers luggage""",3rd April 2025,True,"   I am not satisfied with the way they handle passengers luggage. It was very frustrating when received my luggage bag at Mumbai airport with big cracks in it, so here we buy expensive and strong bags just to make sure our things in it remains safe and due to this irresponsible baggage handling policy we have to think twice before we buy such expensive bags again.",,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuwait to Mumbai,February 2025,3.0,2.0,,3.0,,,5,yes
7,Akasa Air,1,"""I do not recommend Akasa Air""",30th March 2025,True,"   I recently traveled with Akasa Air from Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi as part of my Etihad Airways booking. This was one of the worst airline experiences I have ever had due to poorly trained staff, unprofessional behavior, and unfair baggage policies. Harassment at Check-in Over Name Format At the Bengaluru airport, I was held up for 45 minutes because my middle name was part of my last name in my passport (which is a common format in Indian passports). This same name format was used in my UK visa and all my documents, yet Akasa staff acted as if my passport was incorrect and interrogated me unnecessarily. They completely lacked basic knowledge of name formats and international travel documents. I had 2 kg excess baggage, and instead of allowing me to remove or adjust my items, they forced me to pay ₹11,000!  This was completely unreasonable and felt like a scam.  The ground staff was arrogant, unhelpful, and had no sense of customer service. Instead of assisting passengers, they were rude and dismissive. The way they handled my check-in added unnecessary stress to my journey. If you are flying with Etihad Airways, avoid routes that involve Akasa Air—it will completely ruin your travel experience. I do not recommend Akasa Air to anyone who values professionalism, fairness, and stress-free travel.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi,March 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
8,Batik Air,1,“worth paying more for better service”,31st March 2025,True," Batik Air's airport staff closed the check-in counter earlier than scheduled. When they reopened it, it was already too late to check in. The staff was unhelpful and falsely claimed to have called our names, even though we were present and heard nothing. We had to purchase another ticket to Jakarta because of this. Also, when we were heading to Bangkok, our flight was delayed by almost an hour with no notification or compensation provided. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this airline. It's worth paying more for better service.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Jakarta ,March 2025,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no
9,Bluebird Airways,1,"""do not recommend this airline""",1st April 2025,True,"   Terrible experience with BlueBird Airways! At check-in for flight BZ131 from Rome to Tel Aviv on 23/03/2025, I was forced to pay an additional fee for my trolley, even though it met all carry-on requirements for size and weight, and was paid for with my ticket. The check-in agent didn't measure my luggage, just visually assessed it. This was completely unjustified and caused me financial loss and stress. I will never fly with BlueBird Airways again and do not recommend this airline to anyone.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PSX_20250331_234749-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Tel Aviv ,March 2025,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no

Absolutely no sleep after spending the night in the airport. Could have gotten a hotel, slept, and then gone to the airport. Security was actually open for the next day already. Was offered no food or drink while we waited and all the stores were closed. To add insult to injury, was only offered points to use on another flight at the equivalent of $50.

11,British Airways,9,"""one of the best BA First flights I’ve had""",3rd April 2025,False,"  LHR T5 BA Gold Wing worked well. Pleasant check in and very fast security screening. Concorde room service attentive. C gate boarding OK but nothing special for First Passengers. Latest BA version of first with only 8 suites with privacy doors. Comfortable seat with plenty of stowage. Good screen and good choice of IFE. Amenity kit good quality and bedding, pillows cushions and blankets all good. Excellent menu and food very well presented. Cabin crew could not have been more attentive and helpful without being obtrusive. On time departure and early arrival. Bags delivered relatively swiftly and priority tagged bags were first off.

Cabin crew worked hard, particularly Ivka (?) who was on the go throughout the flight. Everything you would expect of BA (and as it used to be!) Shame the same cannot be said on our recent flight back from Singapore, in Business Class on 11th Feb BA12. Miserable, unhappy and tetchy crew. Too lazy to do anything except sleep!

13,China Airlines,1,“the seat is super tight”,2nd April 2025,True," Very bad. Small plane and the seat is super tight. Seat has no inclination. Suffer for the entire 4-5 hours of flight.

14,Delta Air Lines,8,"""did their jobs with passion""",29th March 2025,True,"   I had a heartbreaking day on my departure day. So when I was checking in at Delta, I was crying…( actually more like bawling). Well I wasn't at first, but when Ms Carol asked me how was my day, tears just fell and couldn’t stop it…felt heavy…so I really appreciate that question a lot, she gave me some small talk, which made me open up a bit and that’s when I started crying. She didn’t have to continue comforting me, but she did and I felt it in my heart. Ms Ammi saw me crying and offered me some juice and orange, and a Chocolate cupcake and also comforted me despite how busy they were. They are the best strangers I’ve encountered at that moment too, for the longest time, and that made me feel way lighter. So I think it’s not about the place, or the airline, it’s the people that works within - a truly unforgettable experience even though that was a month ago. I am talking about the Ground staff of Delta Airlines in Baltimore Airport! They did their jobs with passion and understanding, and I salute them all…",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Seoul via Atlanta,February 2025,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3,yes
15,Discover Airlines,1,"""extremely bad service""",31st March 2025,False,"  I guess no service might be even better than extremely bad service. if you fly with Discover, here is my advice. Bring your own drinks along, and that applies in particular to water. You are offered 0.1 litre complementary water in a cup. If you ask for more, you don't get anything. You may purchase water for an incredible price. And go to the toilet before the flight. Even for a 3.5 hours flight, you are considered as disturbing factor to the flight crew if you go in the toilet. I paid for a full flexible ticket and I knew, I don't get much service. But to get this unmotivated crew was a little shock for me. I will fly them again, to return to my home town, But then: Never.",,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Marrakesh ,March 2025,3.0,1.0,,5.0,3.0,3.0,1,no
16,Discover Airlines,1,"""the flight was unpleasant""",31st March 2025,True,"   First of all, they rejected the entrance while boarding to several passengers because of a wrong boarding group even though it was the last passengers of the previous group and these passengers were asked to go back to the cue. They didn’t allow to put my hand luggage into the airplane because it’s too large. I had to take all my electronics and carry them with me. Seats are uncomfortable and the flight was unpleasant.

17,Discover Airlines,3,"""boarding was a mess""",30th March 2025,True,"   One of the most rude and unprofessional ground and cabin crew. The gate agent screamed at me because I had handed her the boarding pass from my previous flight by mistake; boarding was a mess with the gate being changed three times. The aircraft was parked away from the gate, so we had to use buses to get to the aircraft, which was fine but they made us wait for several minutes inside the bus after bringing us away from the terminal saying that the aircraft wasn't ready.

Service is terrible, food portions are very small and choices are available are all Indian food. No other options available. Only chicken or veg are the two options. After the dinner service no mid flight snack available. Only available option for snack is 4 small Oreo cookies. No water service, have to go to galley and get your water if you need water. Etihad has cut down their service and I felt like I flew on a north American carrier, not a middle eastern carrier.

21,Flair Airlines,1,Flair Airlines customer review,1st April 2025,True,"   I flew light on my recent trip from Calgary to Cancun. All I needed was 5kg of my essential items in tiny 20L backpack. After the arrival at the Calgary airport, I went to finish my online booking at the counter as instructed. The person who finished my check-in looked at my backpack and asked me to slide it into the measuring cage. My backpack didn't fit in thanks to the width. I tried to rearrange the content, but after a few minutes a couple of people behind the counter shouting at me that I'll have to pay the higher fee in the departure hall, I resignated and paid $80. I then proceeded with the custom and all that to finally find my gate. As I'm sitting there, I'm noticing people with bags as big as or even bigger than mine, but they had a purple sticker on it saying it's a small personal item which is for free.  I waited in the line to board my plane to talk to someone about it. When my turn came up I asked a person behind the counter how come a good half of people have a bigger backpacks than me and didn't have to pay extra fee. To which she answered: ""what people?"" I told her, most of them already boarded, but there was definitely a family of 5 that was before me. This family already proceeded through the boarding/passport control, they were on their way to the plane. That woman went and brought the whole family back behind the counter, next to the measuring cage, next to me. She told a man to put his bag into the cage (the smallest bags of them all), that I complained about their luggage. The family obviously upset because they were already processed and didn't understand what was happening. The man was struggling to squeeze his backpack there, taking a few items out, handing them over to his people. I'm standing there embarrassed as hell because everyone passing by to the aircraft was watching this ridiculous scene. The front desk woman turned back to me asked if I was happy now, letting the family go. I was so shocked about this whole situation because I've never experienced a such awful customer service. I didn't come at her with an attitude, I was genuinely curious how come I have to pay a hefty $80 fee, whilst others don't. Just asking for fairness. This person was giving me an attitude from the start. Like how come I dared to have a question.  I figured the reason why they charged me was the fact I paid for no luggage, so at least they could rip me off on my personal item. Not to mention that my 5+ hours flight had zero free refreshments, zero entertainment.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Cancun,March 2025,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

23,Frontier Airlines,1,"""entire experience was a nightmare""",3rd April 2025,True,"   I recently had the worst travel experience with Frontier Airlines on my trip from IAD to SFO with a layover in Atlanta. My first flight from IAD to Atlanta was delayed by 2 hours, which was frustrating but manageable. However, things went from bad to worse when my connecting flight from Atlanta to SFO was delayed by another 3 hours. After finally boarding, the crew suddenly announced that the flight was canceled! To make matters worse, we had to walk what felt like miles through the airport just to reach the ticketing desk to check on hotel accommodations and rebooking options. After all that, Frontier refused to provide a hotel stay, even though they suggested a flight for the next day. And the alternative flight they offered was completely unrealistic, adding over 18 hours to my trip! This entire experience was a nightmare — horrible customer service, ridiculous delays, and zero support when things went wrong. I will never fly with Frontier again, and I highly recommend others avoid them unless you enjoy stress, exhaustion, and disappointment.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to San Francisco via Atlanta,April 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

Delay after delay after delay—which turned out to be a result of poor paperwork from their staff, and zero communication. It isn't so much the delay as it is the clear lack of interest in thr frustration of their passengers. It doesn't matter if they delay a wedding or cut a well-earned vacation short.

I waited 10 days, no refund I called their customer service and was told the refund would be processed again, with another 7 day wait...10 days later no refund, I called again and told their system shows the refund was sent on March 18, it is now March 28 and no refund has been received and they will do nothing else to verify on their end why I have not received a refund and as far as they are concerned the matter is final!",,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Seattle,March 2025,,,,,,,1,no
26,Garuda Indonesia,1,"""won't be flying with them again"" ",31st March 2025,True,"   As an Indonesian expat looking to visit my hometown, I needed quite a lot of baggage room to bring various gifts and knick knacks. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that Garuda Indonesia had a promotion that seemed perfect for my needs. I would pay 800€ for a mixed class flight from Amsterdam to Jakarta, and from there to my hometown to Surabaya with a total allowance of 40kg. flying with Etihad and Singapore airlines worked out to around the same price(with additional baggage), but I thought I'd support the underdog airline. To my dismay, the ticket I'd received only a 30kg allowance. I hurriedly went back to the carrier to make sure I'd bought the right tickets. It turns out that I had. Reaching out to Garuda Indonesia customer service was a nightmare. I was initially told that the tickets where final and that there was nothing they could do about it. I sent a screenshot of the promotion on their website and was eventually told after several hours of going back and forth, and being tossed from one department to another, that it was a confirmed IT system fault and that they could not do anything about it. Resignedly, I asked for a refund at which I was told that I would only receive ~75% of my ticket. Excuse me? this was clearly a garuda fault and false advertising. They escalated it further and I'd finally received an offer of full refund a day or so before the flight date. With no possibility to delay my flight date, and fearing tickets with other airlines were expensive, I felt I had no choice but to take the flight. I tried getting a reimbursement for the extra luggage I had to take but Garuda would only point at KLM, the operating carrier of the first leg, for a reimbursement of the luggage, despite it being Garuda ticketing fault (without being offered a solution or recourse) The most frustrating thing of the experience was that ever email reply I sent was dealt by a different customer service representative who replied with boilerplate and excuses, whereby I had to explain the whole situation again to get anything going. Frankly, the whole customer service run-around felt intentional. Despite all this, I felt that the cabin staff and service on both legs of the flight were pleasant. In the future I definitely won't be flying with them again.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam toSurabayavia via Jakarta ,March 2025,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1,no
27,Gulf Air,5,Gulf Air customer review,2nd April 2025,True,"   Booked gulf air business class UK to China, £1800 RT (not bad) last minute. About 16-18h each way inclusive of layover. Cabin is very quiet, probably about 20-25% full. Service is ok but nothing to get excited about, I unfortunately got woken up for food service despite do not disturb light on, there’s no lie flat seat cover which makes the lie flat a little bumpy. The amenity kit is fine but nothing to get too thrilled over, they do not have pyjamas any more which was a shame as I was very looking forward to sleeping in clean clothes on the second overnight leg of my long flight. Lounge in Bahrain is good, nice food options although they could do with more comfortable seating. Airplane food was fine but again nothing thrilling or very tasty - I ended up skipping a couple meals just out of lack of interest in the options provided. Meant to be a “dine anytime” service but if you ask for food outside of the service the staff look very irritated. I asked for an extra sandwich during the tea service (I’d slept through breakfast) and was told no by the attendant despite the cabin being very quiet and food definitely being tossed given wouldn’t be finished. Overall value isn’t bad for the price you’re paying as other airlines would be many multiples more, but there certainly could be improvements that'd make it a much more premium experience. Cabin WiFi does not work at all. Recommend if you’re looking for a budget lie flat seat. Beyond the seat, may not be worth it for those who prefer a premium experience (there are better Middle Eastern airlines.)",,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Guangzhou via Bahrain,March 2025,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4,yes
28,Hawaiian Airlines,2,"""just how far Hawaiian has fallen""",1st April 2025,True,"   For 20+ years I've been flying Hawaiian Airlines both from West Coast cities to the islands, and to the South Pacific on international routes. While some of their planes have traditionally been older, the service at the airport and onboard always differentiated the airlines. We recently flew first class round trip from PHX to OGG via HNL on the new 787s. Wonderful hard product, for certain that is now fully competitive with what other airlines offer on International service. But the soft product (customer service, food, beverage, etc.) is now awful. From the check-in experience, to the lounges to the in-flight service, it feels like no one wants to work at the airline anymore or cares about customers. It surprised my wife and I just how far Hawaiian has fallen in such a short time of being taken over by Alaska. I am always happy to pay for great service -- and thus I book and pay for full first class fares.

29,Iberia,1,"""lost luggage department is atrocious""",30th March 2025,True,"   Iberia lost luggage department is atrocious. I booked with Iberia to fly from Seattle to Mallorca for a bike trip. I had to change planes in Chicago and Madrid. When I arrived in Mallorca early afternoon on 29th March, neither my bike case nor my suitcase were there. The lost luggage subcontractor created a report and said I would hear from Iberia when my luggage would be delivered. Iberia has a tool on its website for checking the status of lost bags, but I continually got a message that they were having technical difficulties whenever I checked it. By the next morning I had heard nothing, so I called the numbers for Iberia’s lost baggage department. I was told the bags were in the Madrid airport and would be delivered by 1:40 pm (13:40). I went to the airport but my bags were not there. The lost luggage subcontractor had no information at all. I called the lost baggage department back and was told they had not yet received “confirmation” from the Madrid airport’s “lost and found” so could not put the bags on a flight to Mallorca. They refused to tell me why they needed a confirmation from lost and found or when that would be forthcoming. They gave me a number to call the lost and found at Madrid airport. I called Madrid lost and found and they told me they had nothing to do with lost luggage. I called the lost baggage department back and they told me they had no idea where the bags were, that they were waiting to hear from the airports involved and knew nothing about when I would get my bags. I asked them if they had contacted the airports to get information about my bags, and they would not tell me. When I pressed them about what they were doing to get my luggage to me, the representative hung up on me.

31,ITA Airways,1,"""needs to work on its Business Class product""",31st March 2025,True,"   The food in Business Class is disgusting, especially considering that Italy is a Food nation. Mainly cheap bread and a disgusting small salad. Another disappointment is that if you book Business Class for the domestic flight you are seated in Economy Class. And this for one way ticket costs at 985 EUR. Complete rip off. The aircraft was new, the seats nice, but the floor full of dirt.

Outgoing flight was good, however on our return the flights was delayed, then there was an issue with the aircraft and we were assigned a different gate. By this time the flight was over an hour late. Then however we were notified by SMA that our seats had been removed as the aircraft was too small to seat our original passenger count. KLM provided no way of getting us home at all that day. This caused us a lot of stress as we had no childcare arrangements for our kids that evening and meant we missed important work arrangements and a family funeral the next morning. KLM were extremely unsympathetic to our situation at the time and in the ensuing communication. I would not recommend KLM as they are not reliable.

36,Lufthansa,1,"""not given me a cent of reimbursement""",31st March 2025,True,"   I recently (March 2025) was on a business trip from US to Europe. The original flight was cancelled due to a strike in Frankfurt. I fly a lot, so not the first time. But this is when several red flags began to happen. The first red flag was Lufthansa did not offer an alternative flight. The only way to communicate with them was through a chat bot, there was no real person to talk to. The only options I had was to refund my flight and completely new book, which would have been insanely expensive or to update to another flight two days later for an additional $650. Why Lufthansa did not offer this update for free was beyond me to understand. Lufthansa refused to reimburse me these $650. I ended up paying more than $2,500 for a flight ticket from the East Coast of US to Frankfurt.  But it gets better. The first flight was a leg from Raleigh to Newark. That flight was delayed, which then led to me being rebooked on a Lufthansa flight from Newark to Munich, which also was delayed, which then led again for me to be rebooked on a different flight from Munich to Frankfurt. The funny part is that a United customer service agent was able to rebook me last minute on a flight to Germany on Lufthansa. Something that Lufthansa was not able to do two days earlier when their flight was cancelled! This last-minute rebooking of course also led to a downgrade of my booked class. I flew Economy.  Over this entire process, Lufthansa has lost my luggage. At that point, I only had two days in Europe anyways, but all the appointments that I cramped into those two days had to be cancelled, because I literally only had one change of cloth with me. Thankfully my mother lives in Germany, so I could rent a car and drive to my mother to stay until my luggage was found. At that point, I already has another flight to Asia, so I lost an entire week of work, thanks to Lufthansa. At the end of the day, I paid more than $2,500 for an economy class flight from Raleigh to Frankfurt, that was more than 48 hours too late, and during which my luggage was lost. Lufthansa has not given me a cent of reimbursement. Dealing with their customer service, which you only can reach via web portal, is an absolute pain. They expect you to know all the Lufthansa specific rules and regulations. It seems their main aim is not to satisfy their customer, but to save as much money as possible. I travel a lot for work, and I flew many many airlines in my life. I always looked forward to fly Lufthansa. But this experience has changed my mind. There are many other airlines that fly to Europe. They all have to deal with strikes, they all lose luggage sometimes. But every single airline I ever flew with, even the US based airlines, were friendlier and more helpful in their customer relations than Lufthansa. Lufthansa just lost a customer in me. And I don't wish for anyone to have the same experience.",,A350,Business,Premium Economy,Newark to Frankfurt,March 2025,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1,no
37,Norse Atlantic Airways,5,“a most average experience”,2nd April 2025,True," It was a most average experience across the Atlantic. The check-in and gate staff at Gatwick were professional yet brusque, didn't seem like they had much of a sense of humor or desire to be there. The seat was clean enough, until I noticed some dust and grime around different tray tables and arm rests at, as well as in the area around, my seat. Some prior customer had even stuck chewing gum in the seat back pocket in front of me, camouflaged with the color of the seat back so that I didn't notice it until almost takeoff. Gross. The meals, snacks and drinks served on board were perfectly fine, if pricey for what they were, but then I understand that's how budget airlines the world over make their money. I noticed a change in attitude from flight attendants after about two hours into the flight, after all of those meals, goodies and drinks had been purchased en masse by the passengers. That change, at least in my interpretation, was that the flight attendants went from being quite chipper, to just professional and aloof (although there was one FA who was consistently friendly and sweet throughout the flight, period, so credit where credit is due). Another thing, I wish that Norse would include a flight map to track the route, like Spirit in the US includes for its flights. Lastly, it was telling that the same type of American who flocks to Florida en masse to vacation, is basically the same type of British person who treks across the Atlantic to Florida - the type of person who takes trashy clothing and cheap sweatpants to an art form. In all...I would make this flight again for the right price point, but I would also come in with zero expectations of anything other than getting from point A to point B.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Orlando,March 2025,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4,yes
38,Norwegian,4,"""see no point in using their app""",3rd April 2025,True,"   Customer service is terrible, endless phone queues and slow, inconsistent chat responses. A simple name correction (due to an error caused by their own booking system) led to a fee of €130 and took hours to resolve. This is the kind of issue that should be easy to handle directly in their app, creating a fantastic customer experience, but instead, Norwegian completely fails here. I see no point in using their app except for accessing your boarding pass. I strongly recommend choosing another airline if hassle-free service matters to you.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2563-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Stockholm to Malaga,May 2024,,,,,,,3,no
39,Pegasus Airlines,1,"""forcing me to buy a new ticket""",31st March 2025,False,"  Under no circumstances should you choose Pegasus Airlines for your trips. This is their new policy—dodging responsibility with a laugh. Due to the negligence of an employee and a computer malfunction at the gate, I missed my flight. What's even more ridiculous is their unprofessional behavior: first, they told me they would change my ticket, but then they simply took me to the Pegasus ticket counter and abandoned me, forcing me to buy a new ticket. The customer support hasn’t done anything about it so far either. And if there was even a slight chance of enjoyment in Turkey, this airline compensates for it and ruins it for the poor passengers.

I have been using Qatar Airways for a few years for all my international travel, and I can plan with confidence my onward travel, meetings etc. The onboarding process is seamless, and the ground staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. During flights, the same level of professionalism can be expected, and there are no surprises. I fly the same long-distance route approximately every four weeks, and the experience remains consistent. The food is usually excellent, but on my last trip a few days ago, the Doha-Amman leg, the dinner was exceptional, serving dishes that you do not usually see on flights (to clarify - I flew business class).

Then finally an announcement that the plane is being changed – followed by another 15 minutes of complete silence. Eventually we boarded a different aircraft and took off over two hours late. My patience with this airline has run out – this was the last time I fly with them. The only real advantage is that they operate from Łódź, but that’s no longer enough to justify the hassle. The prices stopped being attractive a long time ago, and flying into Stansted means you still have to get on a train to get to London.

From the moment my flight was canceled, Scoot made no effort to help me get home. No rebooking, no alternative options. I was stranded. When I called their customer service, I was told that my case would be escalated but no one ever got back to me. Not a single email, not a call, not even an automated message. Before this mess started, the ground staff at my previous airport assured me that someone in Singapore would assist me. Had I known this was a blatant lie, I never would have taken that flight to Singapore in the first place. Instead, I ended up stuck at the airport with zero support and no way home. When I sought help from Scoot’s ground staff in Singapore, I was met with rudeness, indifference, and unprofessionalism.  Scoot proudly claims to be a “proud sister of Singapore Airlines”, but this is clearly just empty marketing. When I asked to be transferred to a Singapore Airlines flight so I could get home, I was told, “That’s not possible.” Scoot did not provide any assistance — no hotel, no food, no transport. I will never fly with Scoot or Singapore Airlines again. Not only do they not care about their passengers, but their complete lack of professionalism and compassion is appalling.

46,Spirit Airlines,6,"""don't have any real expectations""",3rd April 2025,True,"   vI've flown with Spirit several times and also contacted their customer service center in the past to cancel a flight. Spirit can vary wildly in terms of cancellations, delays, timeliness, and staff attitudes. If using a ratio, two experiences to every one have been overwhelming positive. But the remaining one experience has royally sucked. Still, I take my chances with Spirit, because they've come to treat me more respectfully as a customer than most other US carriers, pound for pound. It helps that I understand the concept of ultra-budget airlines, having flown them around the world, and that I treat airline staff with courtesy and politeness. This most recent trip from Orlando to Louisville was mostly positive. 100% friendly airline staff on ground, and friendly though not particularly attentive in air (they only came down the aisle once to collect trash). Check-in online was easy, though it helped that I wasn't checking a bag. The flight took off and arrived early. The immediate seat was clean enough, but the seat back pocket and tray table were a bit nasty. They tout their WiFi as being the fastest of any US airline, though I haven't tried it. But I did manage to use their unpaid WiFi connection to track the flight route to Louisville on my phone, so that was cool. In all, Spirit as great, as long as you keep a good attitude and don't have any real expectations. That's the point of budget airlines, right?

Since I don’t speak the language, I relied on the screen for updates, but unfortunately, the screen never reflected any changes, and I ended up missing my flight. The situation got worse when I tried to get help. The staff informed me that they could rebook me, but the next available flight wasn’t for another five days. They refused to offer a refund and directed me to contact the third-party provider I booked my ticket with (Capital One). As a result of missing my flight, I had to spend additional money on new accommodations and buy a new flight with another airline.

The flight boarded and took off but had to return to the airport for a technical issue. The flight attendant said the plane was out of balance. This was after 1 1/2 hours into the flight. Then we were put on the Skybridge while the problems, more than just the weight distribution were fixed. One point to consider was I had a 7 hour layover in Seoul. We finally took off again after a long wait. Upon arriving in San Francisco (SFO), the connecting flight had taken off an hour earlier. I was supposed to have a 3 hour layover in SFO. I had to wait another 13 hours for another flight. no meal voucher, no hotel room, no compensation. After finally arriving in Raleigh (RDU) my luggage was not present. So I had to file a claim for lost luggage. No compensation or any concern about it. The Luggage claims desk did not even know there was a flight arriving that morning.

To make matters worse, they didn’t provide compensation, a hotel stay, food, or any kind of support.

This cost me over $2,000, plus an extra $100 for food and drinks while I had to stay up all night and all day at the airport. We were stranded there for over 14 hours, and during this time, both of my siblings suffered from dehydration due to the lack of proper rest and resources.
