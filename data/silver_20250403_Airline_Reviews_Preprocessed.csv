0,Aeromexico,5.0,"""Return flight had problems""",2025-03-30,True,"   I booked London - Mexico City - London Business Class tickets. Outgoing flight gave us access to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow and it was excellent. Return flight had problems: could not check in or select meal on-line using iPad (their website only works on Microsoft). Though in transit, I had to go through immigration, baggage reclaim and security before handing back my luggage to be loaded on the flight home. Refused admittance to their Heineken lounge because I presented more than 3 hours early (just arrived on their flight from Cuba) Lounge was noisy, cramped and spartan when I did get in.

2,Air Canada rouge,10.0,"""showing if the bathroom is occupied""",2025-03-29,False,"  Flight was awesome. Staff was awesome. My issue is the fact that Air Canada doesn't notify people that there is a light showing if the bathroom is occupied or not. Green if available, red if occupied. The stewardess had to keep returning people to their seats as they kept lining up and blocking the aisle. A simple glance can tell you if there is someone already in the bathroom. In the business section they keep the curtain closed. You might think no one is using the bathroom but it could be the pilot or co-pilot, but a simple glance up will show you that it is available or not.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250327_194908-1-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Dominican Republic,2025-03-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,e3d01b5c957953c87a79ff0869dbcd98c2323b0b5a0ca1620f2f347ae1aa7fa5

I asked the lady am I allowed 25 kg plus 7 as I have connected international flight with Thai, she put on hold and replied yes you will be allowed 25 kg plus 7. When I reached Chandigarh airport the staff said no u can’t carry more than 15 kg, you can only carry 25 if you have connected international flight through Air India. I had to suffer and I miss my flight, she said you can board the flight without the luggage, which was a joke, I had to reissue my Thai ticket where I had to pay a penalty of $420 plus the fare I spend on this flight.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chandigarh to New Delhi,2025-04-01,,,,1.0,,,1,no,a116ba41fc9a766f5da46bfcee3468d97f3072da451bc9350dc01f6a7db32a45
4,Air Transat,2.0,"""insists that my carry-on is too big""",2025-03-31,True,"   I had the most ridiculous experience on my way back from Portugal. We had only brought carry-ons and checked-in online, but to get our boarding passes they made us get in line and go through check-in anyway. When we get to the front a worker insists that my carry-on is too big, even though we took the same plane on the way there and there was no issue!! I tell her ""this makes no sense. We flew with you guys here and it fits in the over head"" so she tells me to weigh it and says it's overweight. It turns out the rules online say the weight requirements are ""light enough that you can lift it without assistance"". So they make me pay 76 EUROs to check it and then I find out the flight was full. I guess they were trying to make room, but instead of asking people to check their carry-on for free like normal, they wanted to ring more cash out of people who booked a flight with just carry on bags. I take 6 trips a year with the same carry on bag and have never experienced this.

7,Akasa Air,1.0,"""I do not recommend Akasa Air""",2025-03-30,True,"   I recently traveled with Akasa Air from Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi as part of my Etihad Airways booking. This was one of the worst airline experiences I have ever had due to poorly trained staff, unprofessional behavior, and unfair baggage policies. Harassment at Check-in Over Name Format At the Bengaluru airport, I was held up for 45 minutes because my middle name was part of my last name in my passport (which is a common format in Indian passports). This same name format was used in my UK visa and all my documents, yet Akasa staff acted as if my passport was incorrect and interrogated me unnecessarily. They completely lacked basic knowledge of name formats and international travel documents. I had 2 kg excess baggage, and instead of allowing me to remove or adjust my items, they forced me to pay ₹11,000!  This was completely unreasonable and felt like a scam.  The ground staff was arrogant, unhelpful, and had no sense of customer service. Instead of assisting passengers, they were rude and dismissive. The way they handled my check-in added unnecessary stress to my journey. If you are flying with Etihad Airways, avoid routes that involve Akasa Air—it will completely ruin your travel experience. I do not recommend Akasa Air to anyone who values professionalism, fairness, and stress-free travel.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi,2025-03-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,ef71f602b1c40a84b80a9b3b5b7dc80f0fcb25067604ab8b4f1b41a774aaa87d
8,Batik Air,1.0,“worth paying more for better service”,2025-03-31,True," Batik Air's airport staff closed the check-in counter earlier than scheduled. When they reopened it, it was already too late to check in. The staff was unhelpful and falsely claimed to have called our names, even though we were present and heard nothing. We had to purchase another ticket to Jakarta because of this. Also, when we were heading to Bangkok, our flight was delayed by almost an hour with no notification or compensation provided.

At check-in for flight BZ131 from Rome to Tel Aviv on 23/03/2025, I was forced to pay an additional fee for my trolley, even though it met all carry-on requirements for size and weight, and was paid for with my ticket. The check-in agent didn't measure my luggage, just visually assessed it. This was completely unjustified and caused me financial loss and stress.

14,Delta Air Lines,8.0,"""did their jobs with passion""",2025-03-29,True,"   I had a heartbreaking day on my departure day. So when I was checking in at Delta, I was crying…( actually more like bawling). Well I wasn't at first, but when Ms Carol asked me how was my day, tears just fell and couldn’t stop it…felt heavy…so I really appreciate that question a lot, she gave me some small talk, which made me open up a bit and that’s when I started crying. She didn’t have to continue comforting me, but she did and I felt it in my heart. Ms Ammi saw me crying and offered me some juice and orange, and a Chocolate cupcake and also comforted me despite how busy they were. They are the best strangers I’ve encountered at that moment too, for the longest time, and that made me feel way lighter. So I think it’s not about the place, or the airline, it’s the people that works within - a truly unforgettable experience even though that was a month ago.

Bring your own drinks along, and that applies in particular to water. You are offered 0.1 litre complementary water in a cup. If you ask for more, you don't get anything. You may purchase water for an incredible price. And go to the toilet before the flight. Even for a 3.5 hours flight, you are considered as disturbing factor to the flight crew if you go in the toilet. I paid for a full flexible ticket and I knew, I don't get much service.

The aircraft was parked away from the gate, so we had to use buses to get to the aircraft, which was fine but they made us wait for several minutes inside the bus after bringing us away from the terminal saying that the aircraft wasn't ready.

21,Flair Airlines,1.0,Flair Airlines customer review,2025-04-01,True,"   I flew light on my recent trip from Calgary to Cancun. All I needed was 5kg of my essential items in tiny 20L backpack. After the arrival at the Calgary airport, I went to finish my online booking at the counter as instructed. The person who finished my check-in looked at my backpack and asked me to slide it into the measuring cage. My backpack didn't fit in thanks to the width. I tried to rearrange the content, but after a few minutes a couple of people behind the counter shouting at me that I'll have to pay the higher fee in the departure hall, I resignated and paid $80. I then proceeded with the custom and all that to finally find my gate. As I'm sitting there, I'm noticing people with bags as big as or even bigger than mine, but they had a purple sticker on it saying it's a small personal item which is for free.  I waited in the line to board my plane to talk to someone about it. When my turn came up I asked a person behind the counter how come a good half of people have a bigger backpacks than me and didn't have to pay extra fee. To which she answered: ""what people?"" I told her, most of them already boarded, but there was definitely a family of 5 that was before me. This family already proceeded through the boarding/passport control, they were on their way to the plane. That woman went and brought the whole family back behind the counter, next to the measuring cage, next to me. She told a man to put his bag into the cage (the smallest bags of them all), that I complained about their luggage. The family obviously upset because they were already processed and didn't understand what was happening. The man was struggling to squeeze his backpack there, taking a few items out, handing them over to his people. I'm standing there embarrassed as hell because everyone passing by to the aircraft was watching this ridiculous scene. The front desk woman turned back to me asked if I was happy now, letting the family go. I was so shocked about this whole situation because I've never experienced a such awful customer service. I didn't come at her with an attitude, I was genuinely curious how come I have to pay a hefty $80 fee, whilst others don't. Just asking for fairness. This person was giving me an attitude from the start. Like how come I dared to have a question.  I figured the reason why they charged me was the fact I paid for no luggage, so at least they could rip me off on my personal item. Not to mention that my 5+ hours flight had zero free refreshments, zero entertainment.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Cancun,2025-03-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,d9eaf6d33180164053d70003aac4d3669867da03cdc071065e8461e6ea410cd1

23,Frontier Airlines,1.0,"""entire experience was a nightmare""",2025-04-03,True,"   I recently had the worst travel experience with Frontier Airlines on my trip from IAD to SFO with a layover in Atlanta. My first flight from IAD to Atlanta was delayed by 2 hours, which was frustrating but manageable. However, things went from bad to worse when my connecting flight from Atlanta to SFO was delayed by another 3 hours. After finally boarding, the crew suddenly announced that the flight was canceled! To make matters worse, we had to walk what felt like miles through the airport just to reach the ticketing desk to check on hotel accommodations and rebooking options. After all that, Frontier refused to provide a hotel stay, even though they suggested a flight for the next day. And the alternative flight they offered was completely unrealistic, adding over 18 hours to my trip!

26,Garuda Indonesia,1.0,"""won't be flying with them again"" ",2025-03-31,True,"   As an Indonesian expat looking to visit my hometown, I needed quite a lot of baggage room to bring various gifts and knick knacks. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that Garuda Indonesia had a promotion that seemed perfect for my needs. I would pay 800€ for a mixed class flight from Amsterdam to Jakarta, and from there to my hometown to Surabaya with a total allowance of 40kg. flying with Etihad and Singapore airlines worked out to around the same price(with additional baggage), but I thought I'd support the underdog airline. To my dismay, the ticket I'd received only a 30kg allowance. I hurriedly went back to the carrier to make sure I'd bought the right tickets. It turns out that I had. Reaching out to Garuda Indonesia customer service was a nightmare. I was initially told that the tickets where final and that there was nothing they could do about it. I sent a screenshot of the promotion on their website and was eventually told after several hours of going back and forth, and being tossed from one department to another, that it was a confirmed IT system fault and that they could not do anything about it. Resignedly, I asked for a refund at which I was told that I would only receive ~75% of my ticket. Excuse me? this was clearly a garuda fault and false advertising. They escalated it further and I'd finally received an offer of full refund a day or so before the flight date. With no possibility to delay my flight date, and fearing tickets with other airlines were expensive, I felt I had no choice but to take the flight. I tried getting a reimbursement for the extra luggage I had to take but Garuda would only point at KLM, the operating carrier of the first leg, for a reimbursement of the luggage, despite it being Garuda ticketing fault (without being offered a solution or recourse) The most frustrating thing of the experience was that ever email reply I sent was dealt by a different customer service representative who replied with boilerplate and excuses, whereby I had to explain the whole situation again to get anything going. Frankly, the whole customer service run-around felt intentional. Despite all this, I felt that the cabin staff and service on both legs of the flight were pleasant.

27,Gulf Air,5.0,Gulf Air customer review,2025-04-02,True,"   Booked gulf air business class UK to China, £1800 RT (not bad) last minute. About 16-18h each way inclusive of layover. Cabin is very quiet, probably about 20-25% full. Service is ok but nothing to get excited about, I unfortunately got woken up for food service despite do not disturb light on, there’s no lie flat seat cover which makes the lie flat a little bumpy. The amenity kit is fine but nothing to get too thrilled over, they do not have pyjamas any more which was a shame as I was very looking forward to sleeping in clean clothes on the second overnight leg of my long flight. Lounge in Bahrain is good, nice food options although they could do with more comfortable seating. Airplane food was fine but again nothing thrilling or very tasty - I ended up skipping a couple meals just out of lack of interest in the options provided. Meant to be a “dine anytime” service but if you ask for food outside of the service the staff look very irritated. I asked for an extra sandwich during the tea service (I’d slept through breakfast) and was told no by the attendant despite the cabin being very quiet and food definitely being tossed given wouldn’t be finished. Overall value isn’t bad for the price you’re paying as other airlines would be many multiples more, but there certainly could be improvements that'd make it a much more premium experience. Cabin WiFi does not work at all. Recommend if you’re looking for a budget lie flat seat. Beyond the seat, may not be worth it for those who prefer a premium experience (there are better Middle Eastern airlines.)",,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Guangzhou via Bahrain,2025-03-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4,yes,36d11cddf97d08eb4af8d7b1a7399ac7313c2f15ecff8e1d2a47bd7e94a3c188

While some of their planes have traditionally been older, the service at the airport and onboard always differentiated the airlines. We recently flew first class round trip from PHX to OGG via HNL on the new 787s. Wonderful hard product, for certain that is now fully competitive with what other airlines offer on International service. But the soft product (customer service, food, beverage, etc.) is now awful. From the check-in experience, to the lounges to the in-flight service, it feels like no one wants to work at the airline anymore or cares about customers. It surprised my wife and I just how far Hawaiian has fallen in such a short time of being taken over by Alaska. I am always happy to pay for great service -- and thus I book and pay for full first class fares.

29,Iberia,1.0,"""lost luggage department is atrocious""",2025-03-30,True,"   Iberia lost luggage department is atrocious. I booked with Iberia to fly from Seattle to Mallorca for a bike trip. I had to change planes in Chicago and Madrid. When I arrived in Mallorca early afternoon on 29th March, neither my bike case nor my suitcase were there. The lost luggage subcontractor created a report and said I would hear from Iberia when my luggage would be delivered. Iberia has a tool on its website for checking the status of lost bags, but I continually got a message that they were having technical difficulties whenever I checked it. By the next morning I had heard nothing, so I called the numbers for Iberia’s lost baggage department. I was told the bags were in the Madrid airport and would be delivered by 1:40 pm (13:40). I went to the airport but my bags were not there. The lost luggage subcontractor had no information at all. I called the lost baggage department back and was told they had not yet received “confirmation” from the Madrid airport’s “lost and found” so could not put the bags on a flight to Mallorca. They refused to tell me why they needed a confirmation from lost and found or when that would be forthcoming. They gave me a number to call the lost and found at Madrid airport. I called Madrid lost and found and they told me they had nothing to do with lost luggage. I called the lost baggage department back and they told me they had no idea where the bags were, that they were waiting to hear from the airports involved and knew nothing about when I would get my bags. I asked them if they had contacted the airports to get information about my bags, and they would not tell me. When I pressed them about what they were doing to get my luggage to me, the representative hung up on me.

KLM provided no way of getting us home at all that day. This caused us a lot of stress as we had no childcare arrangements for our kids that evening and meant we missed important work arrangements and a family funeral the next morning.

36,Lufthansa,1.0,"""not given me a cent of reimbursement""",2025-03-31,True,"   I recently (March 2025) was on a business trip from US to Europe. The original flight was cancelled due to a strike in Frankfurt. I fly a lot, so not the first time. But this is when several red flags began to happen. The first red flag was Lufthansa did not offer an alternative flight. The only way to communicate with them was through a chat bot, there was no real person to talk to. The only options I had was to refund my flight and completely new book, which would have been insanely expensive or to update to another flight two days later for an additional $650. Why Lufthansa did not offer this update for free was beyond me to understand. Lufthansa refused to reimburse me these $650. I ended up paying more than $2,500 for a flight ticket from the East Coast of US to Frankfurt.  But it gets better. The first flight was a leg from Raleigh to Newark. That flight was delayed, which then led to me being rebooked on a Lufthansa flight from Newark to Munich, which also was delayed, which then led again for me to be rebooked on a different flight from Munich to Frankfurt. The funny part is that a United customer service agent was able to rebook me last minute on a flight to Germany on Lufthansa. Something that Lufthansa was not able to do two days earlier when their flight was cancelled! This last-minute rebooking of course also led to a downgrade of my booked class. I flew Economy.  Over this entire process, Lufthansa has lost my luggage. At that point, I only had two days in Europe anyways, but all the appointments that I cramped into those two days had to be cancelled, because I literally only had one change of cloth with me. Thankfully my mother lives in Germany, so I could rent a car and drive to my mother to stay until my luggage was found. At that point, I already has another flight to Asia, so I lost an entire week of work, thanks to Lufthansa. At the end of the day, I paid more than $2,500 for an economy class flight from Raleigh to Frankfurt, that was more than 48 hours too late, and during which my luggage was lost. Lufthansa has not given me a cent of reimbursement. Dealing with their customer service, which you only can reach via web portal, is an absolute pain. They expect you to know all the Lufthansa specific rules and regulations. It seems their main aim is not to satisfy their customer, but to save as much money as possible. I travel a lot for work, and I flew many many airlines in my life. I always looked forward to fly Lufthansa. But this experience has changed my mind. There are many other airlines that fly to Europe. They all have to deal with strikes, they all lose luggage sometimes. But every single airline I ever flew with, even the US based airlines, were friendlier and more helpful in their customer relations than Lufthansa. Lufthansa just lost a customer in me.

37,Norse Atlantic Airways,5.0,“a most average experience”,2025-04-02,True," It was a most average experience across the Atlantic. The check-in and gate staff at Gatwick were professional yet brusque, didn't seem like they had much of a sense of humor or desire to be there. The seat was clean enough, until I noticed some dust and grime around different tray tables and arm rests at, as well as in the area around, my seat. Some prior customer had even stuck chewing gum in the seat back pocket in front of me, camouflaged with the color of the seat back so that I didn't notice it until almost takeoff. Gross. The meals, snacks and drinks served on board were perfectly fine, if pricey for what they were, but then I understand that's how budget airlines the world over make their money. I noticed a change in attitude from flight attendants after about two hours into the flight, after all of those meals, goodies and drinks had been purchased en masse by the passengers. That change, at least in my interpretation, was that the flight attendants went from being quite chipper, to just professional and aloof (although there was one FA who was consistently friendly and sweet throughout the flight, period, so credit where credit is due). Another thing, I wish that Norse would include a flight map to track the route, like Spirit in the US includes for its flights. Lastly, it was telling that the same type of American who flocks to Florida en masse to vacation, is basically the same type of British person who treks across the Atlantic to Florida - the type of person who takes trashy clothing and cheap sweatpants to an art form.

This is the kind of issue that should be easy to handle directly in their app, creating a fantastic customer experience, but instead, Norwegian completely fails here.

What's even more ridiculous is their unprofessional behavior: first, they told me they would change my ticket, but then they simply took me to the Pegasus ticket counter and abandoned me, forcing me to buy a new ticket.

46,Spirit Airlines,6.0,"""don't have any real expectations""",2025-04-03,True,"   vI've flown with Spirit several times and also contacted their customer service center in the past to cancel a flight. Spirit can vary wildly in terms of cancellations, delays, timeliness, and staff attitudes. If using a ratio, two experiences to every one have been overwhelming positive. But the remaining one experience has royally sucked. Still, I take my chances with Spirit, because they've come to treat me more respectfully as a customer than most other US carriers, pound for pound. It helps that I understand the concept of ultra-budget airlines, having flown them around the world, and that I treat airline staff with courtesy and politeness. This most recent trip from Orlando to Louisville was mostly positive. 100% friendly airline staff on ground, and friendly though not particularly attentive in air (they only came down the aisle once to collect trash). Check-in online was easy, though it helped that I wasn't checking a bag. The flight took off and arrived early. The immediate seat was clean enough, but the seat back pocket and tray table were a bit nasty. They tout their WiFi as being the fastest of any US airline, though I haven't tried it. But I did manage to use their unpaid WiFi connection to track the flight route to Louisville on my phone, so that was cool.

50,United Airlines,1.0,"""not received any compensation""",2025-03-29,False,"  I took my annual vacation to Cebu Philippines in November 2024. The attendants are not very professional nor friendly. The return flight was even worse.  The flight from Seoul (ICN) was the biggest issue. The flight boarded and took off but had to return to the airport for a technical issue. The flight attendant said the plane was out of balance. This was after 1 1/2 hours into the flight. Then we were put on the Skybridge while the problems, more than just the weight distribution were fixed. One point to consider was I had a 7 hour layover in Seoul. We finally took off again after a long wait. Upon arriving in San Francisco (SFO), the connecting flight had taken off an hour earlier. I was supposed to have a 3 hour layover in SFO. I had to wait another 13 hours for another flight. no meal voucher, no hotel room, no compensation. After finally arriving in Raleigh (RDU) my luggage was not present. So I had to file a claim for lost luggage. No compensation or any concern about it. The Luggage claims desk did not even know there was a flight arriving that morning. I had to make numerous phone calls, one representative actually laughed about it. I have not received any compensation from United for their lack of professionalism, and availability to conduct a flight operation within a reasonable schedule.",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Raleigh Durham via Seoul,2024-11-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1,no,ad69d0471b664c8518d1379cba789840da5d7a9662e00a363a53322aabbd0349

Nothing to complain as ground staff, cabin crew were professional and offered the best that they could. Seat was comfortable. I chose the Japanese breakfast and found that it was somehow delicious. Inflight entertainment, surprisingly, was excellent with new movies and music album.

52,Vietnam Airlines,6.0,"""Inflight entertainment was good""",2025-04-03,True,"   Flight was on time and ground service was handled professionally by the Japanese staff. Economy class passengers were offered blankets and pillows on this flight. Lunch was at average quality, not bad but not good too. Inflight entertainment was good too.

53,Vietnam Airlines,1.0,"""Never again, Vietnam Airlines""",2025-03-31,True,"   The flight was just 2 hours delayed, but this was the smallest issue. At the arrival I recognised my luggage is damaged, a Samsonite 300 USD one. As a compensation they offered me 11 USD. I heard many people had issues with damaged luggage but compensation is actually nothing. Cannot recommend to hand any luggage to them. After checking with their customer service they insist on 300.000 VND (11 USD).

54,Volaris,1.0,"""think twice before booking with Volaris""",2025-04-02,True,"   I wasn’t able to fly with Volaris on March 30, 2025, at 4:45 PM because they overbooked the flight and canceled two of the three seats I had booked months in advance—one for my brother and one for my sister. While my seat was still available, I obviously wasn’t going to fly without them. Volaris made no effort to resolve the issue and offered absolutely no assistance. To make matters worse, they didn’t provide compensation, a hotel stay, food, or any kind of support. I was forced to book a last-minute flight with another airline for the next day since there were no available flights that same night. This cost me over $2,000, plus an extra $100 for food and drinks while I had to stay up all night and all day at the airport. We were stranded there for over 14 hours, and during this time, both of my siblings suffered from dehydration due to the lack of proper rest and resources. The lack of professionalism and customer service from Volaris was beyond frustrating. This was my first experience with them, and it will definitely be my last. I strongly advise others to think twice before booking with Volaris.",,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Oakland,2025-03-01,,,,1.0,,,1,no,7b6af8a42d0281eb4d4e0ec0d603b0c3fd7f0e6f28ec3d3c250c90f131c473a0

58,Vueling Airlines,1.0,"""seat is not refundable""",2025-04-02,True,"   Was held at check-in where someone took my passport, did not explain what's wrong and had to talk with multiple people to get it back? Was asked to scan my boarding pass multiple times despite it working from the very first time? Never got an explanation and was asked hastily to go on the plane. Bought priority seats and everything but by the time I was onboard I had to put my luggage further down, delaying everything on my way off. Stewardesses did nothing, both in the beginning or the end. Asked a refund as I basically didn't benefit from the priority ticket/seat. Didn't have space for one piece of luggage, let alone two. Received email today that seat is not refundable which is insane given the subpar service on literally everything.
